payola-viz
==========

This project is developed as a replacement for visualization parts in Payola project. Its goal is to provide better reliability, scalability and resolve some issues which cannot be easily resolved Payola due to its architecture.

Based on LDVM principles, it enables a user to visualized data in their dataset while it automatically offers list of suitable visualizers.

Right now, it provides those visualization techniques:
- DataCube
- OpenLayers WKT multipolygon (in progress)

It also provides a simple JSON API in order to allow creating datasources and visualizations automatically by 3rd party software.
